# TitanicKaggleML


In this project, we try to build a model that can predict whether a certain passenger would have survived the titanic crash. This is famous data science competition on Kaggle! We do some data analysis to find important variables, some data processing and feature engineering to get our data ready for the model, create (and tune) the model using hyperparameter tuning, and finally validate our model using performance metrics.
